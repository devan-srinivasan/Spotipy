# Spotipy
We used spotify's api and acoustic data to intelligently generate new playlists for users based on their existing ones. We did so by analyzing sound properties of the songs and using a similarity tree network to recommend new songs.

Built with my good friend Conrad: https://github.com/ConradMS
